# canvas
## Playing with Canvas API, maths, shapes &amp; colors for fun and learning (old app from 2014 with some fixes ;)

You can find some images like this in the "images" directory:

![example image 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielxdad/canvas/main/images/example-img-10.png)

![example image 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielxdad/canvas/main/images/example-img-9.png)

![example image 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielxdad/canvas/main/images/example-img-11.png)

You can serve/run the web app with the built-in http server of Python 3: "python3 -m http.server"

And then open it in the navigator: "http://localhost:8000/"
